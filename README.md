# Iowa Carbon Pipelines Project

Description: This map helps users locate Iowa counties impacted by planned carbon pipeline construction, ordinances, and litigation. Research for this project was conducting by staff and research assistants of the Hubbell Environmental Law Initiative at the University of Iowa College of law. With questions, concerns, or suggestions about the content on this map, please contact Blake Rupe at [brupe@uiowa.edu](brupe@uiowa.edu). This application was developed by the University of Iowa Libraries' Digital Scholarship & Publishing Studio. The locations of the planned pipelines were digitized by researchers at the FracTracker Alliance and appear here courtesy of [Dr. Ted Auch](https://www.fractracker.org/author/ted-auch/), the Midwest Program Director of the FracTracker Alliance.
